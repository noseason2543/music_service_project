- grenade
path: /video/bruno/grenade.mp3


Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh<br>
Take, take, take it all, but you never give<br>
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss<br>
Had your eyes wide open<br>
Why were they open? (Ooh)<br>
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash<br>
You tossed it in the trash, you did<br>
To give me all your love is all I ever ask<br>
'Cause what you don't understand is<br>
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Oh, oh, I would go through all this pain<br>
Take a bullet straight through my brain<br>
Yes, I would die for ya, baby<br>
But you won't do the same<br>
No, no, no, no<br>
Black, black, black and blue<br>
Beat me 'til I'm numb<br>
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from<br>
Mad woman, bad woman<br>
That's just what you are<br>
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car<br>
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash<br>
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did<br>
To give me all your love is all I ever ask<br>
'Cause what you don't understand is<br>
I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Oh oh, I would go through all this pain<br>
Take a bullet straight through my brain<br>
Yes, I would die for ya, baby<br>
But you won't do the same<br>
If my body was on fire<br>
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames<br>
You said you loved me, you're a liar<br>
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby<br>
But darling, I'd still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Oh oh, I would go through all this pain<br>
Take a bullet straight through my brain<br>
Yes, I would die for ya, baby<br>
But you won't do the same<br>

Oh, her eyes, her eyes<br>
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'<br>
Her hair, her hair<br>
Falls perfectly without her tryin'<br>
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday<br>
Yeah, I know, I know<br>
When I compliment her, she won't believe me<br>
And it's so, it's so<br>
Sad to think that she don't see what I see<br>
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"<br>
I say<br>
When I see your face<br>
There's not a thing that I would change<br>
'Cause you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
And when you smile<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
Yeah<br>
Her lips, her lips<br>
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me<br>
Her laugh, her laugh<br>
She hates, but I think it's so sexy<br>
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday<br>
Oh, you know, you know<br>
You know I'd never ask you to change<br>
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same<br>
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay<br>
You know I'll say<br>
When I see your face<br>
There's not a thing that I would change<br>
'Cause you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
And when you smile<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
The way you are<br>
The way you are<br>
Girl, you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
When I see your face<br>
There's not a thing that I would change<br>
'Cause you're amazing<br>
Just the way you are<br>
And when you smile<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause girl, you're amazing<br>

I know you're somewhere out there<br>
Somewhere far away<br>
I want you back, I want you back<br>
My neighbors think I'm crazy<br>
But they don't understand<br>
You're all I have, you're all I have<br>
At night, when the stars light up my room<br>
I sit by myself<br>
Talking to the moon<br>
Trying to get to you<br>
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too<br>
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?<br>
Oh<br>
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town<br>
They say I've gone mad<br>
Yeah, I've gone mad<br>
But they don't know what I know<br>
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back<br>
Yeah, they're talking back, oh<br>
At night, when the stars light up my room<br>
I sit by myself<br>
Talking to the moon<br>
Trying to get to you<br>
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too<br>
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?<br>
Do you ever hear me calling?<br>
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon<br>
Still trying to get to you<br>
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too<br>
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?<br>
Oh<br>

- when i was your man

Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now<br>
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same<br>
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down<br>
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name<br>
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo<br>
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize<br>
That I should have bought you flowers<br>
And held your hand<br>
Should have gave you all my hours<br>
When I had the chance<br>
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance<br>
Now my baby's dancing<br>
But she's dancing with another man<br>
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways<br>
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life<br>
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh<br>
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes<br>
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo<br>
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize<br>
That I should have bought you flowers<br>
And held your hand<br>
Should have gave you all my hours<br>
When I had the chance<br>
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance<br>
Now my baby's dancing<br>
But she's dancing with another man<br>
Although it hurts<br>
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong<br>
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late<br>
To try and apologize for my mistakes<br>
But I just want you to know<br>
I hope he buys you flowers<br>
I hope he holds your hand<br>
Give you all his hours<br>
When he has the chance<br>
Take you to every party<br>
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance<br>
Do all the things I should have done<br>
When I was your man<br>
Do all the things I should have done<br>
When I was your man<br>
