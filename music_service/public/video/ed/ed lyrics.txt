- afterglow
path: /video/ed/after-glow.mp3


Stop the clocks, it's amazing<br>
You should see the way the light dances off your head<br>
A million colours of hazel, golden and red<br>
Saturday morning is fading<br>
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand<br>
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again<br>
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle<br>
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow<br>
So alone in love like the world had disappeared<br>
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go<br>
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow<br>
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears<br>
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow<br>
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow<br>
The weather outside's changing<br>
The leaves are buried under six inches of white<br>
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine<br>
This is a new dimension<br>
This is a level where we're losing track of time<br>
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I<br>
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle<br>
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow<br>
So alone in love like the world had disappeared<br>
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go<br>
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow<br>
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears<br>
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow<br>
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow<br>
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow<br>

We are, we are, we are<br>
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer<br>
Sundown and they all come out<br>
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers<br>
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown<br>
Everybody's lookin' for a come up<br>
And they wanna know what you're about<br>
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'<br>
We're just tryna figure everything out<br>
We don't fit in well<br>
'Cause we are just ourselves<br>
I could use some help<br>
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah<br>
You look stunning, dear<br>
So don't ask that question here<br>
This is my only fear, that we become (hey)<br>
Beautiful people<br>
Drop top, designer clothes<br>
Front row at fashion shows<br>
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"<br>
Inside the world of beautiful people<br>
Champagne and rolled-up notes<br>
Prenups and broken homes<br>
Surrounded, but still alone<br>
Let's leave the party<br>
That's not who we are<br>
(We are, we are, we are)<br>
We are not beautiful<br>
Yeah, that's not who we are<br>
(We are, we are, we are)<br>
We are not beautiful (beautiful)<br>
L.A. (mmm) drove for hours last night<br>
And we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)<br>
I see stars in your eyes<br>
When we're halfway there (all night)<br>
I'm not fazed by all them lights<br>
And flashin' cameras<br>
'Cause with my arms around you<br>
There's no need to care<br>
We don't fit in well<br>
We are just ourselves<br>
I could use some help<br>
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah<br>
You look stunning, dear (ah)<br>
So don't ask that question here<br>
This is my only fear<br>
That we become (hey)<br>
Beautiful people<br>
Drop top, designer clothes<br>
Front row at fashion shows<br>
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"<br>
Inside the world of beautiful people<br>
Champagne and rolled-up notes<br>
Prenups and broken homes<br>
Surrounded, but still alone<br>
Let's leave the party<br>
That's not who we are<br>
(We are, we are, we are)<br>
We are not beautiful, yeah<br>
Yeah, that's not who we are<br>
We are not beautiful (beautiful)<br>
We are, we are, we are<br>

She played the fiddle in an Irish band<br>
But she fell in love with an English man<br>
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand<br>
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"<br>
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar<br>
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar<br>
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?<br>
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?<br>
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun<br>
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun<br>
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar<br>
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance<br>
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band<br>
But she fell in love with an English man<br>
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand<br>
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"<br>
With my pretty little Galway Girl<br>
You're my pretty little Galway Girl<br>
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool<br>
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room<br>
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool<br>
After dancing to CÃ¨ilidh singing to trad tunes<br>
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet<br>
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat<br>
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week<br>
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me<br>
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band<br>
But she fell in love with an English man<br>
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand<br>
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"<br>
My pretty little Galway Girl<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl<br>
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time<br>
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine<br>
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine<br>
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night<br>
I walked her home then she took me inside<br>
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine<br>
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write<br>
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night<br>
She played the fiddle in an Irish band<br>
But she fell in love with an English man<br>
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand<br>
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"<br>
My pretty little Galway Girl<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl<br>
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl<br>








- happier
path: /video/ed/happier.mp3


Walking down 29th and Park<br>
I saw you in another's arms<br>
Only a month we've been apart<br>
You look happier<br>
Saw you walk inside a bar<br>
He said somethin' to make you laugh<br>
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours<br>
Yeah, you look happier, you do<br>
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you<br>
But ain't nobody love you like I do<br>
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby<br>
If you're movin' on with someone new<br>
'Cause baby you look happier, you do<br>
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too<br>
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth<br>
But I know I was happier with you<br>
Sat in the corner of the room<br>
Everything's reminding me of you<br>
Nursing an empty bottle<br>
And telling myself you're happier, aren't you?<br>
(Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah)<br>
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)<br>
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)<br>
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey, yeah, hey, yeah)<br>
But my darlin', I am still in love with you<br>
But I guess you look happier, you do<br>
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too<br>
I could try to smile to hide the truth<br>
But I know I was happier with you<br>
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah<br>
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah<br>
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah<br>
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey, yeah<br>
'Cause baby, you look happier, you do<br>
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new<br>
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do<br>
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you<br>

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at<br>
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah<br>
Wondering if I could sneak out the back<br>
Nobody's even looking me in my eyes<br>
Then you take my hand<br>
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)<br>
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?<br>
You make it better like that<br>
Don't think I fit in at this party<br>
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)<br>
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm<br>
Who wants to fit in anyway?<br>
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah<br>

We at a party we don't wanna be at<br>
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves<br>
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back<br>
With all these people all around<br>
I'm crippled with anxiety<br>
But I'm told it's where we're s'posed to be<br>
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind<br>
When you make it better like that<br>
Don't think we fit in at this party<br>
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah<br>
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm<br>
But now I think that we should stay<br>

I found a love for me<br>
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
Not knowing what it was<br>
I will not give you up this time<br>
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
And in your eyes, you're holding mine<br>
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song<br>
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
Fighting against all odds<br>
I know we'll be alright this time<br>
Darling, just hold my hand<br>
Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
I see my future in your eyes<br>
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
I have faith in what I see<br>
Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
And she looks perfect<br>
I don't deserve this<br>
You look perfect tonight<br>






- photograph
path: /video/ed/photograph.mp3

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes<br>
But it's the only thing that I know<br>
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes<br>
It is the only thing makes us feel alive<br>
We keep this love in a photograph<br>
We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts are never broken<br>
And time's forever frozen, still<br>
So you can keep me<br>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home<br>
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul<br>
And it's the only thing that I know, know<br>
I swear it will get easier<br>
Remember that with every piece of ya<br>
Hmm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die<br>
Hmm, we keep this love in a photograph<br>
We made these memories for ourselves<br>
Where our eyes are never closing<br>
Hearts were never broken<br>
And time's forever frozen, still<br>
So you can keep me<br>
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans<br>
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet<br>
You won't ever be alone<br>
And if you hurt me<br>
That's okay, baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages, you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Wait for me to come home<br>
Oh, you can fit me<br>
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen<br>
Next to your heartbeat where I should be<br>
Keep it deep within your soul<br>
And if you hurt me<br>
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed<br>
Inside these pages, you just hold me<br>
And I won't ever let you go<br>
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me<br>
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street<br>
Hearing you whisper through the phone<br>
"Wait for me to come home"<br>






- shape of you
path: /video/ed/shape-of-you.mp3


The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
So the bar is where I go<br>
Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
Drinking fast and then we talk slow<br>
Come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
And trust me I'll give it a chance now<br>
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox<br>
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like<br>
Girl, you know I want your love<br>
Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
Come, come on now, follow my lead<br>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
Although my heart is falling too<br>
I'm in love with your body<br>
And last night you were in my room<br>
And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
Every day discovering something brand new<br>

I'm in love with your body<br>
Every day discovering something brand new<br>
I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
One week in we let the story begin<br>
We're going out on our first date<br>
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate<br>
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
And how your family is doing okay<br>
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like<br>
Girl, you know I want your love<br>
Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
Come on now, follow my lead<br>
I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>

When your legs don't work like they used to before<br>
And I can't sweep you off of your feet<br>
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love<br>
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks<br>
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70<br>
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23<br>
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<br>
And I just wanna tell you I am<br>
So honey now<br>
Take me into your loving arms<br>
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
Place your head on my beating heart<br>
I'm thinking out loud<br>
Maybe we found love right where we are<br>
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades<br>
And the crowds don't remember my name<br>
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm<br>
I know you will still love me the same<br>
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen<br>
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory<br>
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>
Maybe it's all part of a plan<br>
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes<br>
Hoping that you'll understand<br>
But baby now<br>
Take me into your loving arms<br>
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
Place your head on my beating heart<br>
I'm thinking out loud<br>
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh<br>
So baby now<br>
Take me into your loving arms<br>
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart<br>
I'm thinking out loud<br>
That maybe we found love right where we are<br>
Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)<br>
And we found love right where we are<br>
